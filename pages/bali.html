        <p class="flow-text light">In Balinese mythology and healing traditions, leyaks play a prominent role. They are said to be beings in the form of a flying head with entrails still attached, usually found around graveyards. Leyaks also have an unusually long tongue and large fangs, mainly using them to suck a newborn child’s or a pregnant mother’s blood. How frightening!</p>
        <p class="flow-text light">Rangda, the demon queen of Leyaks, is said to have eternally waged war against the male embodiment of positive forces, the playful Barong. Rangda’s story is also linked to the legend of Calon Arang, the legendary widow witch who damaged corps and brought diseases in ancient Java in late 10th century. She had a daughter named Ratna Manggali, who though beautiful, was not able to get married because people feared her mother. This angered Calon Arang and she proceeded to kidnap a young girl. She sacrificed the girl at the temple of Death, to the goddess Durga, and soon after, a flood engulfed the village, killing many.</p>
        <p class="flow-text light">King Airlangga, upon hearing about the matter, asked for Empu Bharada for advice. Emphu Bharada then sent his disciple, Empu Bahula, to be married to Ratna. They threw a huge wedding feast that lasted for seven days and nights. This brought peace to the kingdom after that.</p>
        <p class="flow-text light">Another interpretation claims that Rangda was actually queen Mahendradatta, the mother of King Airlangga and wife to King Udayana. Because she was allegedly practising witchcraft and black magic, she was condemned and exiled by her husband. Out of hurt and humiliation, she sought revenge upon her ex-husband’s court and his kingdom. She summoned all the evil spirits from the jungle to bring death and destruction everywhere.</p>
